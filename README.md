# ML-Web-Assistant
Our Python Mini-Project using `Flask`, `NLTK` and `Tensorflow`. Since it is a Web based app, we have used `Flask` at the backend and the Chatbot is developed using `NLTK` which is used to work with Human readable data and make it easier for the Progran to understand and `Tensorflow` with DNN i.e. Deep Neural Network 

The Bot is named T.I.N.A. which stands for:
```
T - Tensorflow
I - Integrated
N - Neural network
A - Assistant
```
